    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scalloped potatoes are one of those foods that always feel festive. A bubbling, creamy, cheesy casserole of tender potatoes, sometimes bolstered with meat like ham or bacon, under a crust of melted cheese or crispy breadcrumbs. It is a classic side dish for holiday meals, especially since it can be made ahead and reheated, and the richness means that a little goes a long way, so a pan feeds a crowd. But if you did not grow up with scalloped potatoes on your table, they can feel a little bit daunting as a cooking project.</p>
